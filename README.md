# Kokoloko Draft — a Discord bot

This repo has the dev container cloned from my dev env repo and includes the .py files that describe a Discord bot.

This bot can be used to do a Kokoloko Draft, which is a self-coined term for a Pokémon Draft with semi-randomly picked Pokémon

The conditions under which the bot makes the picks will be explained soon...
